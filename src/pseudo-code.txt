load the default policy data into a defaultPolicy bean from the default-policy.yaml file

if the policy file to be loaded is not the default one
  then identify the fields in the varied policy files
  and override with these values in their respective fields in defaultPolicy

---

load the defaul-policy.yaml file

if the policy file to be loaded is not the default one
  load the varied policy partial file and override the respective values in default-policy

create the policy bean

---

can yaml do some trickery to override with partials?

---

could just overwrite yaml document before loading
  regex / find-replace
  hook into snakeyaml (or other lib), and find/replace in map (before it gets turned into bean)

---

load defaultYaml as Object
load partialYaml as Object

find and replace values in defaultYaml map

convert defaultYaml map into Policy

---

if object contains properties that contain other objects
  go into those other objects (ad infinity)
    for each field in the object
      if the field is not null
        copy it
else
  for each field in the object
    if the field is not null
      copy it
